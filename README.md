## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
1. Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset? 
Non-random amomunts of variance to the model are statistically provided by the vehicle lenght and the vehicle ground clearance. They both impact the miles per gallon on the prototype. The other variables (vehicle weight, spoiler angle, and AWD) provide random amounts of variance in the dataset. 
2. Is the slope of the linar model considered to be zero? Why or why not? 
The p-Value is less than the significance level of 0.05%. We can reject our null hypothesis because this indicates that the slope is not zero. 
3. Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not? 
This model has an r-squared value of 0.7149. Approximately 71% of all mpg predictions will be determined by this model and can predict mpg of prototypes effectively.
## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils 
The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance foe the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individauly. Why or Why not? 
## T-Tests on Suspension Coils
Briefly summarize your interpretation and findings for the t-test results. Include screenshots of the t-test to support your summary. 
## Study design: MechaCar vs Competition
Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs agains the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating. 
It would be interesting to analyze comparable models from the competition. 
1. What metric or metrics are you going to test? 
Safety Feature Rating, Current Selling Price, Engine Type (Electric, Hybrid, Gasoline / Conventional), Resale Value, and MPG. 
3. What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis? 
- Null Hypothesis: According to key factors of performance, MechaCar is priced correctly. 
- Alternative Hypothesis: According to key factors of performance, MechaCar is NOT priced correctly.
